    <p><b>SYNERGIA</b> emulates the
      <a href="https://encyclotronic.com/synthesizers/digital-keyboards/digital-keyboards-synergy-r458/" target="_blank">
      dki Synergy</a> synthesizer as a VST3/AU plugin.
      The original Synergy was released in 1982 as one of the first commercial digital synthesizers,
      featuring additive and FM synthesis in its core.
      It appears on several Wendy Carlos' works, including the <i>Tron</i> soundtrack and the classic
      <i>Beauty in the Beast</i> album, as well as on Donald Fagen's first solo album <i>Nightfly</i>.
      Synergy is based on earlier
      <a href="https://encyclotronic.com/synthesizers/digital-keyboards/crumar-general-development-system-gds-r457/" target="_blank">
      Crumar GDS</a> and Bell Labs
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs_Digital_Synthesizer" target="_blank">
      Alles Machine</a> designs.
    </p>
    <p><b>Synergia</b> plugin attempts to reproduce Synergy's sound as accurately as possible.
      The plugin runs the original eprom binary in an emulated z80 environment, and models the discrete
      oscillator board in integer arithmetic. Other subsystems such as the front panel, keyboard,
      sequencer, cartridge, midi and external control ports are modeled as well. Analog board
      antialiasing filter's linear properties are approximated, but nonlinearities of the DAC,
      filter and amp sections are yet to be implemented. The plugin has preliminary support for
      Wendy Carlos' custom microtonal Synergy build.
    </p>
    <p>The plugin is currently in beta testing. If things proceed as planned, the downloads will appear
      here in late November 2020. For more info contact <a href="mailto:jariseon@yahoo.com">jariseon -at- yahoo.com</a>
    </p>

  <section id="docs" class="hidden">
    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    <h3>installation</h3>
    <p>The downloaded zip file contains a Mac or Windows installer for standalone, vst3
      and au plugins. Double-click the pkg (Mac) or exe (Windows) file and follow the installer wizard.
      The binaries are unsigned, so Catalina users might need an additional step as explained in this
      brief <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHoTH-OWGnA" target="_blank">video</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Synergy cartridge images</h3>
    <p><b>Synergia</b> supports CRT files in original Synergy cartridge format. These can be found
      online, or prepared using the
      <a href="https://chinenual.github.io/synergize/" target="_blank">Synergize</a> patch
      editor/librarian. The CRT files are variable length, around 8kB in size
    </p>
    <p>One or more CRT fies may be dropped onto the plugin gui to make them appear in the
      <span>BANK</span> combobox.
      Mac version also accepts a folder of CRT files. When dropped, all CRT files contained in the folder
      become available in the current session, as well as in future launches of the plugin. In Windows,
      the related cartridges folder is located in Application Data/username/Roaming/Synergia folder.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:20;">Operation</h2>
    <p>The operation of the plugin follows the hardware Synergy as explained in the original
      <a href="https://encyclotronic.com/uploads/13823c33de54c6717622a56b9850f0df.pdf" target="_blank">
      user manual</a>. Plugin specific details are described briefly below.
    </p>

    <h3>Switches and Knobs</h3>
    <p>Synergia's front panel controls mimic their hardware counterparts. In short: an active
      <i>switch</i> is indicated with a lit red led. Some switches have multiple states, which are
      indicated
      with a slow/fast blinking led.
      Most <i>knobs</i> also have a led, which is lit when the knob is in tracking, i.e., active mode.
      To activate a knob, turn it all the way to left, and then right until the led above it becomes lit.
    </p>

    <h3>Top Row</h3>
    <div class="asset">
      <img src="res/toprow.png">
    </div>
    <p>The two top left buttons tab between <span>PERFORMANCE</span> and <span>EFFECTS</span> views
      of the upper panel. The <span>ACTIVATE FX</span> toggle activates (green)
      or bypasses (as shown above) the effects section. The <span>SCALE</span>
      combobox activates an alternative tuning system, or resets it back to the factory default equal
      temperament with option "synergy". <span>FLAT | WOOD</span> toggles between the two provided skins.
    </p>

    <h3>Upper Panel : PERFORMANCE View</h3>
    <div class="asset">
      <img src="res/upper-perf.png">
    </div>
    <p>The oscillator board is monophonic, but capable of spreading individual notes
      to left, right, or both channels. Synergia's effects section is stereophonic.
      The two leftmost knobs are used to set channel specific volume levels. The
      <span>LINK</span> toggle - once activated as green - moves both knobs in tandem. The rest of the controls work as detailed
      in the Synergy user manual. Pitch bend and modulation section is currently disabled.
      Bend and modulation work via midi though.</p>

    <h3>Upper Panel : EFFECTS View</h3>
    <div class="asset">
      <img src="res/upper-fx.png">
    </div>
    <p>The Effects are cascaded in series from left to right. Each effect may be activated individually
      by clicking on its caption (green indicates active state). Note that the top row
      <span>ACTIVATE FX</span> toggle needs to be on as well.
    </p>

    <div id="fx">
    <p><span>EQ</span> has three identically parametrized biquad bands. The symbols at the top of
      each band select highpass, peaking/notch and lowpass <i>modes</i>. the band is in bypass mode
      if none of the mode symbols is selected. <i>Freq</i> and <i>Q</i> knobs adjust cutoff/center
      frequencies and resonance/bandwith of the biquad, respectively. <i>Gain</i> is available only
      in peaking/notch mode: center position denotes no gain, positions to the left control notch
      depth, and positions to the right adjust peak height.
    </p>
    <p><span>AUTOPAN</span> pans the signal in stereo space. it is driven by a triangle or square
      <i>shape</i>d LFO. <i>Depth</i> controls stereo width of panning, while <i>Rate</i> sets the
      LFO speed.
    </p>
    <p><span>SPREAD</span> thickens the sound by mixing in slightly <i>Detune</i>d phantom
      oscillators. <i>Amount</i> controls the level of the phantoms, and expands the
      spatial image of the mix. Middle position gives full stereo spread, while higher values
      work as a "dimension expander".
    </p>
    <p><span>DELAY</span> provides separate controls for each channel (<i>L</i> or <i>R</i>), or
      links the controls together when <i>LR</i> is active. <i>Mix</i> controls the dry/wet ratio,
      and <i>Time</i> sets the delay amount. The center position of <i>Feedback</i> knob denotes
      zero feedback. positions to the left control cross-channel feedback level, and positions to
      the right do the same for straight feedback effect.
    </p>
    <p><span>PHASER</span> <i>Mix</i> sets dry/wet ratio, <i>Depth</i> controls notch depths, and
      <i>Feedback</i> the intensity of the effect (zero at noon, left for classic negative feedback).
      <i>Rate</i> sets driving LFO speed, and finally, <i>Freq</i> sets the the notch sweep range.
    </p>
    <p><span>REVERB</span> <i>Mix</i> sets dry/wet ratio, <i>Width</i> sets the stereo width,
      <i>Size</i> controls the room size, and <i>Damp</i> the high frequency damping.
    </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Lower Panel</h3>
    <div class="asset">
      <img src="res/lower-panel.png">
    </div>
    <p>The <span>BANK/VOICE</span> section at the right side manages the presets. the <i>upper combobox</i>
      switches banks by activating the internal sound rom (INTERNAL.ROM) or one of the
      CRT format cartridge files. Initially, only INTERNAL.ROM/CRT are available. More CRT format
      files may be added by drag'n'dropping them onto the interface, as described in the Quick Start
      section above.
      The <i>lower combobox</i> selects one of the 24 available presets in the active bank. It duplicates
      the functionality of the <span>VOICE</span> switches.
    </p>
    <p>The <i>Cartridge</i> switch toggles between internal and cartridge banks, and is linked with the
      state of the upper combobox. The <i>VRAM</i> switch activates yet another bank which is managed
      by the external control software. Once activated, Synergia appears as a target device in the
      Synergize patch editor/librarian, which can then be used to manage the VRAM bank, and edit
      the presets in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>The remaining sections in the lower panel work as in hardware Synergy, and are detailed in
      the user manual.

    <p>Synergia embeds the original Synergy v3.21 roms, which to the best of my knowledge are in
      the public domain. Distributing the roms with the plugin simplifies installation a lot,
      and thus helps to keep Synergy alive! However, if you own the copyrights to the roms and oppose
      this strategy, please email me and i will remove the roms from the distribution.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The plugin emulates the z80 cpu at the original clock frequency, which requires a fairly large
      <i>buffer size</i>. I've been happy with 512 samples @ 48kHz, but if you are experiencing
      glitches, extending the buffer size further should help. I'm exploring various optimization options
      to hopefully lower the buffer size requirement in a future version.
    </p>
    <p><i>Microtonal support</i> is still preliminary, and the keyboard mappings do not yet work properly:
      the just tunings require a key-specific mapping (e.g., a mapping made for C major
      sounds out of tune in Eb major without such a kbm setting). So far I've planned two options for
      this: A) an extra one octave virtual
      keyboard at the bottom-left corner of the display for manual key switching, and B) a chord
      analyzer that deduces the key from currently held midi notes to make the switch automatically.
      Other ideas are most welcome.
    </p>
    <p>I've not yet analyzed Synergy's aliasing footprint. Based on Kevin Doren's original
      filter plots i'm currently using a linear-phase <i>antialiasing filter</i> with the response
      shown below. The filter starts a steep roll off after 12kHz, and goes a bit deeper than what was presented
      in Kevin's plots. I need to most probably tweak it after i get more captures from a real Synergy.
